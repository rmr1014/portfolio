Key projects/contributions:
•
ClearPathAdapter Dockerization: Initiated and executed this effort to create a "one-click" debugging environment with dependencies using Docker Compose. This streamlined the development process and improved team efficiency. I also fixed broken local docker-compose files and found a way to reference them within others.
•
RecordingFeeLinking Service: Created this service, refactoring hundreds of lines of code. It automatically links recording fees and taxes for specific document types. This saved approximately 250+ hours of team member time per month and helped close the gap on verifying recorded documents and collected fees. The service was built to be understandable and extensible.
•
NotaryPackageManagement (NPMS) Service Development: Led the setup and development of this new service. Engineered the backend following Clean Architecture principles and integrated NServiceBus messaging. Configured the full DevOps infrastructure (created repo, set up 6 pipelines, Scalr workspaces, Helm charts, database). Diagrammed the database schema and created tables/procedures. Maintained the NPMS Wiki for documentation alongside code. Contributed to the shift from MSSQL to PostgreSQL, saving the company $1000/month. Introduced a quality gate to encourage code coverage and standards. Fixed integration tests and automated their daily runs.
•
Encompass Integration Infrastructure & CI/CD: Embraced and learned AWS for this project. Set up CI/CD pipelines, configured pipeline yamls, created Docker compose and README instructions for local dev ease. Set up Helm Charts for Kubernetes and incorporated NServiceBus messaging for resilience. Utilized Scalr for UI infrastructure. A key accomplishment was eliminating the required user sign-in for the integration, addressing a major pain point. Fixed issues related to API changes and Snyk vulnerabilities. Improved local development setup. Cleaned up backend code and increased test coverage to 89.5%. Fixed SQL transaction saturation issues. Made a RabbitMQ instance configured out-of-the-box for new developers.
•
Production Support & Quality Improvements: Spearheaded efforts for better testing, monitoring, and alerting. Established a team on-call rotation in PagerDuty. This improved response times and early issue detection, reducing downtime and disruption. Improved logging and telemetry for better insights and diagnostics. Consistently writes clean code and contributes to code quality through thorough PR reviews. Keeps repositories organized. Has a solid command of tracing and resolving issues.
•
Documentation Initiatives: Championed comprehensive and up-to-date documentation across multiple services. Consistently adds and updates documentation alongside code. Created a dedicated 'documentation' folder in repositories. This improves knowledge sharing, reduces onboarding time, and helps other teams collaborate.

For each highlighted project, provide screenshots or links to the live project (if applicable) and links to the source code repository on GitHub, ensuring documentation is clear.
6. Open Source Contributions / Community Involvement Include links to projects contributed to or created.
•
